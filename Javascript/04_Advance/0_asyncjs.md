# how to make JS async? 
## callback, promise, async await


# Promises are commonly used to handle asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from a server, reading a file, or executing a timer.

# A promise can be in one of three states:
**Pending:** The initial state, before the promise is resolved or rejected.
**Fulfilled (Resolved):** The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a resulting value.
**Rejected:** There was an error during the operation, and the promise has a reason for the failure.

<!-- why promises? -->  
# easy to read
# easy to maintain code.
# error handling
# promise all operations

<!-- new Promise((res, reject, error)=>{

}).then().catch() -->
